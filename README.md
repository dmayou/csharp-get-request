# C# Client
C# (pronounced C sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. (Wikipedia)

My goals are to use C# as:
- to write Hello World to the console, and
- connect to a local server to consume a RESTful API

I will do this by making a console app so that the only output is to the console.
